# Bartok-Prototype
The Bartok Prototype was created from the book "Unity and C#. Gamedev from idea to implementation" [Jeremy Gibson].
This prototype is based on the Prospector Solitaire prototype. In this card game, the player needs to discard all cards into a common deck. A card is discarded when it is of the same suit or level as a card in the deck.
